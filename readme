  dev notes
    - vore should always trust websites as the source of authority
      this is why posts aren't saved to disk - there's no good way to
      uniquely identify them over time easily. a new website might
      show up & reuse the post urls, and i want to avoid all of the
      complexities that introduces by just fetching feeds at runtime
      & loading them live - that way we're SURE they're fresh and
      accurate.
  
    - do not natively display posts
      posts always look like shit away from their home websites. instead
      of doing any of that nonsense, vore just takes website snapshots
      via archive.org and presents them to the user.
  
    - saved entries will NEVER change/expire
      if a user uses the "save" feature, the data they were looking at
      must never be lost.
      therefore, we just copy whatever the active post state was from
      memory & also snapshot the website via archive.org & link to the
      snapshot. this way, there's always a cached version available
      to use.
  
      website may be saved multiple times, i don't care.
  
      TODO "this has been saved already" indicator
    - vore prefers raw URLs, we don't care about traditional RSS
      formats like OPML

  soon(tm):
    - non-active feeds will be retried at a much slower cadence
      (& remembered across restarts)
