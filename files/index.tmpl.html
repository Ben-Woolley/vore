hey ya'll, sorry for that outage!
i was on vacation & when i got back,
work was on fire. this is the first
actually free moment i've had for awhile.

i'm so happy that so many of you use
this website, i feel very grateful for
your presence.

vore.website is a minimal, no-bullshit web-based rss/atom feed reader.

vore.website is free for anyone to use, and will never be turned into a vehicle for profit.

vore.website is a love letter to the rss world - long live syndication!!!


history:

      2020: <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/jrss">jrss</a> is born
jrss had one concept: define list of feeds, and jrss will keep that list up to date and display it to you via the web.

      2021: <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/j3s.sh">j3s.sh</a> consumes jrss
my main website eventually consumed jrss because it was easier to maintain.

      2023: <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/vore">vore</a>
vore takes the simple foundation from j3s.sh and exposes it as a hosted service for anyone to use!
rss lovers rejoice.


love,

<a href="https://j3s.sh">jes</a>
